subfetch.py

Author: Mauricio Teixeira &lt;mauricio.teixeira at gmail.com&gt;

Developed just as Python practice, to help a friend fetch subtitles for his
video files.

NOTE: as of now, this script only downloads subtitles in Brazilian Portuguese.

Usage:

./subfetch.py -t &lt;dir|file&gt;

Check --help for other options.

Part of this code is based on:
- subdownloader
  http://www.subdownloader.net/
- OpenSubtitles API examples
