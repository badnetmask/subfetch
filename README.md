Developed by Mauricio Teixeira, just as Python practice, to help a friend
fetch subtitles for his video files.

NOTE: as of now, this script only downloads subtitles in Brazilian Portuguese.

Usage:

./subfetch.py -t <dir|file>

Optionally you can use -v to see what the script is doing.

Part of this code is based on:
- subdownloader
  http://www.subdownloader.net/
- OpenSubtitles API examples 
  http://trac.opensubtitles.org/projects/opensubtitles/wiki/XMLRPC
